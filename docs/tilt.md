# Tilt

> **Kubernetes for Prod, Tilt for Dev**
>
> Modern apps are made of too many services. Theyâ€™re everywhere and in constant
> communication.
>
> Tilt powers microservice development and makes sure they behave! Run `tilt up`
> to work in a complete dev environment configured for your team.
>
> Tilt automates all the steps from a code change to a new process: watching
> files, building container images, and bringing your environment up-to-date.
> Think `docker build && kubectl apply` or `docker-compose up`.

It's _dope_, try it!
